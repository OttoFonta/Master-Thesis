# Master-Thesis
Project relative to thesis developement

These are the script I used in order to develop my thesis. Inside the NN folder there is everything you need to source in order to run the DNNRegressor.R file.
In the RL.R file you can find the implementation of a reinforcement learning problem, while in the Stochastic Processes R are stored miscellaneous functions used to generate random processes.
